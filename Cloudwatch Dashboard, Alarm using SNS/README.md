# About this project

We are implementing a
monitoring solution that helps the company to monitor key resource metrics
and configure automated notifications in case any performance bottlenecks are
detected.
To build a monitoring and reporting layer for the entire end-to-end solution, we
will leverage CloudWatch dashboards and widgets to get aggregated views of
the health and performance statistics for the EC2 instance and
report any performance bottlenecks via SNS notifications as soon as these are
detected.

 We'll start from [here](https://github.com/warlock601/AWS/blob/f8333a71097cb3ef2d9ef202a85b537b46296af5/Cloudwatch%20Dashboard%2C%20Alarm%20using%20SNS/VPC/README.md)
